# Find 3 objects around the room and create variables from it,
# Insert those variables into an f-string sentence(look at slide 22)in repl.it


# Familiarize yourself with the syntax of the print() function.
# Print your name.
# Print today's date.
# Print the name of your favorite movie.

# Print your name and age on separate lines using a single print() function.
# Use f-strings to print a message like: "In 10 years, [Your Name] will be [Your Age + 10] years old."

#input is when we ask the user for input/data
# Ask the user to enter their name.

# Input Practice #1
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# What are you learning today?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #2
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# Where are you from?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #3
# Write Python code that displays the user's full name on the screen, by allowing them to enter their first and last name with the following instructions:
# What is your name?
# What is your surname?
# The code must be able to print the user's first and last name on the screen, separated by a space.

# Exercise:
# Write a program that asks the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a message using both pieces of information.
